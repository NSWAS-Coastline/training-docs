Welcome to the New South Wales Ambulance Training Documenation
===========================

Welcome to the New South Wales Ambulance Training docs. At the end of each paragraph in the phases, ask the student/s if they have any questions. If they do, answer them before you continue. This is NOT to be shared with any outside organisations or other people which are not ranked Educator in Coastline's NSWAS. If you are found to be leaking any of this, you will be found and blacklisted from NSWAS, and possibly other departments in Coastline.

Certifications
------------------

We have rank-based trainings for every member of the department where they can request and complete them at their own pace. These include:

- ICP Training
- ECP Training
